# This folder contains the same scripts as main, but can be run on a HPC so things can be run quicker

# Note that only some scripts are present, and are simplified for HPC access. e.g. there is no fasta generation here (so this must be done separetly)
# Basically, you may need to alter the change directory locations, and run some things separetly
